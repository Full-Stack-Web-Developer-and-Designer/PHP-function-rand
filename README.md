# PHP function rand
This repository contains a simple single-serving site that randomly changes the background color of the page, text, text styling, font size, font color, and text position. All this was done with the help of the PHP function rand. Also, there is a built-in PHP function count that counts the elements of the array, so regardless of the number of elements in the array, they will always be displayed randomly every time the web page is opened or refreshed. With array_delete function color matching for text and background is prevented.

Of course, this example can be used to modify anything else using the rand function.
